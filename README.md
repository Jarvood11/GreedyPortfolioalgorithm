Greedy Portfolio algorithm
Greedy and non-greedy algorithms
The term "greedy algorithm" was introduced by computer scientist and mathematician Edsger Dijkstra. 
He wanted to calculate the minimum spanning tree.
Robert Prim and Joseph Kruskal came up with optimization methods to minimize the cost of graphs.
Input:
data = {
  "start_time": [2 , 6 , 4 , 10 , 13 , 7],
  "finish_time": [5 , 10 , 8 , 12 , 14 , 15],
  "activity": ["Homework" , "Presentation" , "Term paper" , "Volleyball practice" , "Biology lecture" , "Hangout"]
}
Output
C:\Python311\python.exe "C:\Users\ewent\Desktop\ЦБ\casezhad.py"
Process started (PID=14496) >>>
The student can work on the following activities: ['Homework', 'Presentation', 'Volleyball practice', 'Biology lecture']
<<< Process finished (PID=14496). (Exit code 0)
